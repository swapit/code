# Recommender System for Exchange Platforms

This repository contains an implementation of the method described in our [paper](http://swapit.github.io/data/wsdm238-rappazA.pdf)  

The code can be run through the script `main.m`. This script contains a path to the dataset to be used. For example, you can change it to `data/bookmooch/bm6m/` to run it on a 6 months dataset of Bookmooch.  

The implementation of our method can be found in `mf_bpr.m`.  

The datasets are contained in the `data/` directory or can be downloaded [here](http://swapit.github.io/data/swapit-data.zip).
